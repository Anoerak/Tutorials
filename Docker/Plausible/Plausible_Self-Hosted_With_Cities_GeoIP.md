## Self-hosting installation with Portainer and Cities GeoIP database on Synology NAS

This is the self-hosting installation of Plausible Analytics with Portainer and Cities GeoIP database on a Synology NAS. Since the cities Db
is quite large, it is not included in the Docker image. You'll find the required files in this repository. Please be advised that those
files won't be updated automatically.

## Requirements

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

## Ports and Reverse Proxy

Plausible uses port 8000 by default. You can change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you want to use a reverse proxy, you can use the following configuration:

1. Go to `Control Panel` > `Login Portal` > `Advanced` > `Reverse Proxy`
2. Create a new reverse proxy
3. Click on the `General`tab
4. Set the `Source` to as follows:
    - Protocol: `HTTPS`
    - Hostname: `plausible.yourdomain.com` or if using a synology.me domain `plausible.yourdomain.synology.me`
    - Port: `443`
5. Check the `Enable HSTS` box
6. Set the `Destination` to as follows:
    - Protocol: `HTTP`
    - Hostname: `localhost`
    - Port: `9850`
7. Click on the `Custom Headers` tab
8. Add a new header with the following values by clicking on `create`and then on `WebSocket`:
9. Keep the value offered by default and click on `save`

## SMTP / GMAIL configuration for Plausible

If you want to use the SMTP server of your Synology NAS or your GMAIL account, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file by uncommenting
and modify the following lines:

```yaml
#       SMTP_HOST_ADDR: smtp.gmail.com
#       SMTP_HOST_PORT: 587
#       SMTP_USER_NAME: Your-own-gmail-address
#       SMTP_USER_PWD: Your-own-app-password
```

If you want to use the SMTP server of your Synology NAS, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file by uncommenting and modify the
following lines:

```yaml
#       SMTP_HOST_ADDR: smtp.yourdomain.com
#       SMTP_HOST_PORT: 587
#       SMTP_USER_NAME: Your-own-email-address
#       SMTP_USER_PWD: Your-own-email-password
```

## Installation

(Careful, all file and folder names are case sensitive)

1. Create a folder named `plausible` in the `/docker` folder on your Synology NAS
2. In the `plausible` folder, create a folder named `data`

4. In the `plausible` folder, create a folder named `db`

8. Replace the UID and GID values with your own
9. Replace the environment variables for the SMTP server or your GMAIL account with your own values and replace the `BASE_URL` with your own
   `https://plausible.yourdomain.com` or if using a synology.me domain `https://plausible.yourdomain.synology.me`
10. Deploy the stack
11. Go to `https://plausible.yourdomain.com` or if using a synology.me domain `https://plausible.yourdomain.synology.me`
